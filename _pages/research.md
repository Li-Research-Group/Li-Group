`31.` [Recovery of Nutrients from the Aqueous Phase of Hydrothermal Liquefaction—A Review](https://doi.org/10.3390/w17142099)

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a thermochemical conversion process that converts wet biomass into biocrude oil, a gas phase, a solid phase, and an aqueous phase (HTL-AP). An obstacle to the development and scaling of HTL is the volume of HTL-AP produced during the process, which has high concentrations of nitrogen and carbon and cannot be disposed of in the environment without treatment. The HTL-AP is enriched with organic compounds, particularly light polar organics and nitrogenous compounds, which are inhibitory to microbial treatment in wastewater treatment plants. This review synthesizes published findings on different types of treatment of the HTL-AP for the recovery of valuable nutrients and the removal of toxic compounds. The literature highlights the importance of increasing nitrogen bioavailability in HTL-AP through two-step treatments and by selecting HTL-AP derived from protein-rich feedstocks, which offer higher initial nitrogen content. Further work is needed to optimize chemical and biological treatments for nutrient recovery from HTL-AP, particularly regarding treatment scale and duration. Additionally, economic analyses across different treatment types are currently lacking, but are essential to evaluate their feasibility and practicality.

`30.` [Defining Economic and Environmental Typologies across 77 Countries to Prioritize Opportunities for Non-Sewered Sanitation](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5c02064)

![TOC figure](https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.est.5c02064/asset/images/medium/es5c02064_0005.gif#TOC)

Lack of access to sanitation is a challenge that persists globally, with low sewerage connection rates in many low- and lower-middle-income countries. Engineered nonsewered sanitation (NSS) technologies can meet treatment requirements without sewers, but their relative sustainability varies across potential deployment sites. Here, we characterize the costs and carbon intensity (CI) of three emerging NSS technologies, two community reinvented toilets (CRTs) and one Omni Processor (OP), across 77 countries, identify sustainability performance typologies, and map typology prevalence in countries across the globe. Locality-specific factors such as wages, diet, and material costs drive regional variability in NSS costs by up to 15-fold and CI up to 2-fold within technologies. Across all three NSS technologies and all scenarios evaluated, low-cost, low-CI typologies are predominantly in countries with lower human development indices (HDI 2–4), demonstrating alignment between the sanitation need and the NSS opportunity space. By elucidating key sustainability drivers and defining typologies, this work can support early-stage decision-making for NSS technology research, development, and deployment.

`29.` [Greenhouse Gas Accounting Procedures in Low Carbon Fuel Policies Lead to Undervalued Benefits of Miscanthus-Based Sustainable Aviation Fuel](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssusresmgt.4c00486)

![TOC figure](https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acssusresmgt.4c00486/asset/images/medium/rm4c00486_0004.gif#TOC)

Low carbon fuel policies such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) as well as the 45Z tax credit are intended to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. Rigid carbon intensity (CI) accounting procedures in current policies may limit CI responsiveness across candidate sites and processing facilities. This work examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway using miscanthus and alcohol-to-jet biorefineries. Results demonstrate that GHG accounting using the CFR/LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors in scenario-specific analysis, and most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the importance of life cycle assessment (LCA) methodological specifications in low carbon fuel policies and tax credits.

`28.` [Integration of plant and microbial oil processing at oilcane biorefineries for more sustainable biofuel production](https://doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.13183)

Oilcane—an oil-accumulating crop engineered from sugarcane—and microbial oil have the potential to improve renewable oil production and help meet the expected demand for bioderived oleochemicals and fuels. To assess the potential synergies of processing both plant and microbial oils, the economic and environmental implications of integrating microbial oil production at oilcane and sugarcane biorefineries were characterized.

`27.` [Assessing the Relative Sustainability of Point-of-Use Water Disinfection Technologies for Off-Grid Communities](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00017)

![TOC figure](https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenvironau.4c00017/asset/images/medium/vg4c00017_0005.gif#TOC)

Point-of-use (POU) water disinfection technologies can be adopted to provide access to safe drinking water by treating water at the household level; however, navigating various POU disinfection technologies can be difficult. This research assessed the sustainability of four different POU technologies (chlorination using sodium hypochlorite, a silver-nanoparticle-enabled ceramic water filter, ultraviolet mercury lamps, and ultraviolet light-emitting diodes). Leveraging open-source Python packages (QSDsan and EXPOsan), the cost and environmental impacts of these POU technologies were assessed using techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment. All technologies were further evaluated across ranges of adoption times, and contextual analysis was performed to evaluate the implications of technology deployment across the world.

`25.` [Characterizing the Opportunity Space for Sustainable Hydrothermal Valorization of Wet Organic Wastes](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c07394)

![TOC figure](https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acs.est.3c07394/asset/images/medium/es3c07394_0006.gif#TOC)

Resource recovery from wet organic wastes can support circular economies by creating financial incentives to produce renewable energy and return nutrients to agriculture. In this study, we characterize the potential for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)-based resource recovery systems to advance the economic and environmental sustainability of wastewater sludge, FOG (fats, oils, and grease), food waste, green waste, and animal manure management through the production of liquid biofuels (naphtha, diesel), fertilizers (struvite, ammonium sulfate), and power (heat, electricity). Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of HTL-based resource recovery systems to reduce the costs and carbon intensity of resource-rich organic wastes.

`24.` [Catalytic Hydrothermal Deoxygenation of Stearic Acid with Ru/C: Effects of Alcohol- and Carboxylic Acid-Based Hydrogen Donors](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c01975)

![TOC figure](https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsomega.3c01975/asset/images/medium/ao3c01975_0006.gif#TOC)

Catalytic hydrothermal processing is a promising technology for the production of biofuels used in transportation to alleviate the energy crisis. An important challenge for these processes is the need for an external supply of hydrogen gas to accelerate the deoxygenation of fatty acids or lipids. This study reports on the use of various alcohol and carboxylic acid amendments as sources for in situ hydrogen production to accelerate Ru/C-catalyzed hydrothermal deoxygenation of stearic acid. Addition of these amendments significantly increases yields of liquid hydrocarbon products, including the major product heptadecane, from stearic acid conversion at subcritical conditions (330 °C, 14–16 MPa during the reaction). This research provided guidance for simplifying the catalytic hydrothermal process of biofuel production, making the production of the desired biofuel in one pot possible without the need for an external H<sub>2</sub> supply.

`23.` [Advancing the economic and environmental sustainability of the NEWgenerator non-sewered sanitation system](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenvironau.3c00001)

![TOC figure](https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsenvironau.3c00001/asset/images/medium/vg3c00001_0008.gif#TOC)

Achieving safely managed sanitation and resource recovery in areas that are rural, geographically challenged, or experiencing rapidly increasing population density may not be feasible with centralized facilities due to space requirements, site-specific concerns, and high costs of sewer installation. Nonsewered sanitation (NSS) systems have the potential to provide safely managed sanitation and achieve strict wastewater treatment standards. One such NSS treatment technology is the NEWgenerator, which includes an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR), nutrient recovery via ion exchange, and electrochlorination. The system has been shown to achieve robust treatment of real waste for over 100 users, but the technology’s relative life cycle sustainability remains unclear. This study characterizes the financial viability and life cycle environmental impacts of NEWgenerator and prioritizes opportunities to advance system sustainability through targeted improvements and deployment.

![TOC figure](https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsomega.2c04382/asset/images/large/ao2c04382_0007.jpeg#TOC)

In this study, the metal–organic framework (MOF) was applied as a precursor template to synthesize Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with a carbon matrix shell (M-Co3O4). The effects of catalyst dosage, methanol dosage, water dosage, temperature, and reaction time on catalytic efficiency were examined with stearic acid as the model reactant. Under the designed condition, M-Co3O4 exhibited high catalytic performance and the catalyst showed higher conversion of stearic acid (98.7%) and selectivity toward C8–C18 alkanes (92.2%) in comparison with Pt/C (95.8% conversion and 93.2% selectivity toward C8–C18). The catalysts were also characterized by a series of characterization techniques including electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Finally, we proposed that decarbonization (deCO) could be the presumably mechanistic pathway for the production of C8–C18 alkanes from the decomposition of stearic acid.
