## Graduate Positions

Currently there are no openings in the group. When new opportunities occur, I will advertise on AEESP's [job board](https://www.aeesp.org/jobs). I will also look through students already admitted to Rutgers, and you can learn more about the application process on CEE's [website](https://cee.rutgers.edu/apply-1).
