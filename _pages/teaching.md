## Course Instructed

### Sustainable Design

Through this course, students will develop an understanding of quantitative sustainable design (QSD) and how to navigate engineering decision-making. Students will learn methods and tools for economic (techno-economic analysis, TEA; life cycle costing, LCC) and environmental (life cycle assessment, LCA) sustainability assessments, and how to link these tools to engineering design decisions under uncertainty. Students will apply these tools to design their engineered systems of interest, with special attention to water and energy infrastructure, water quality processes, resource recovery, green chemistry, and bioenergy/bioproducts.

Check out the [course flyer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H-jCpCuH03X1f6CYXQooAZBieMRMUdwS/view?usp=share_link) for Fall 2023.

### Water and Wastewater Treatment Design

This course introduces the theory and its application for design and operation of processes used in water and wastewater treatment; emphasis is on biological treatment processes and related processes for gas transfer, sludge dewatering, sludge disposal, and solids separations.

### Environmental Chemistry

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the fundamental principles that govern chemical and biochemical processes in natural and engineered environmental systems, and to employ quantitative approaches to solving aquatic chemistry problems. 

Key course topics include the thermodynamic and kinetic basis for the composition of aquatic systems, chemical equilibrium, acid-base chemistry, aqueous/gas partitioning, alkalinity and pH buffering, metal speciation and precipitation, redox reactions, and sorption processes. Analytical and numerical approaches to solving chemical problems will be illustrated using topics of interest to environmental engineers and scientists.

## Interactive Modules

I see tremendous potentials in leveraging the open-source platforms developed in my research to build interactive modules to be used in the classroom. My goal is to make these experiences accessible to everyone - regardless of individuals' programing skills.
