## Course Instructed

### Sustainable Design of Water-Energy Systems

The goals of this course are to (i) introduce the concept and method of sustainability design in the context of engineering system design, and (ii) leverage the quantitative sustainable design (QSD) methodology and the open-source platforms in my research for case studies and group projects to engage students with practical applications.

### Environmental Engineering Principles, Chemical

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the fundamental principles that govern chemical and biochemical processes in natural and engineered environmental systems, and to employ quantitative approaches to solving aquatic chemistry problems. 

Key course topics include the thermodynamic and kinetic basis for the composition of aquatic systems, chemical equilibrium, acid-base chemistry, aqueous/gas partitioning, alkalinity and pH buffering, metal speciation and precipitation, redox reactions, and sorption processes. Analytical and numerical approaches to solving chemical problems will be illustrated using topics of interest to environmental engineers and scientists.

## Interactive Modules

I see tremendous potentials in leveraging the open-source platforms developed in my research to build interactive modules to be used in the classroom. My goal is to make these experiences accessible to everyone - regardless of individuals' programing skills.
